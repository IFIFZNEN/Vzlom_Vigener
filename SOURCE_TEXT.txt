The Olympic Games have their own flag and motto. The flag is white with five circles. The circles represent the five continents of Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North and South America. The circles are black, blue, green, red and yellow. The flag of every country in the games has at least one of these colours. The motto of the Olympics is 'Faster, higher, stronger'.
